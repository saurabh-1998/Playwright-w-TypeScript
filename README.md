Playwright supports TypeScript out of the box. You just write tests in TypeScript, and Playwright will read them, transform to JavaScript and run. Note that Playwright does not check the types and will run tests even if there are non-critical TypeScript compilation errors.

We recommend you run TypeScript compiler alongside Playwright.
